# Cookbook

Cookbook is a Java-based application designed to manage and organize recipes. It provides a simple interface for storing, retrieving, and sharing recipes.

This demo is created for the 42Berlin, Devoxx France and Belgium workshops.

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete recipes.
- Search recipes by name or ingredients.
- Share recipes with others.
- REST API for integration with other systems.

## Requirements

- Java 25 Runtime Environment
- Maven 3 for building the project
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- Ollama (make sure to pull the models that you want to use, as the app won't pull them automatically)
- Redis Stack (for the RAG part)

## Build and Run

### Using Maven

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/cookbook.git
   cd cookbook
   ```
2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   java -jar target/cookbook-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

### Using Docker

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t cookbook .
   ```
2. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run --net host cookbook
   ```

Note: we're using `--net host` to make it easier for the Java
app to communicate with Ollama when Ollama is running locally.

### RAG part

For the RAG part, you need to run a Redis Stack instance, for instance with:
```bash
docker run -p 6379:6379 -d --name redis-stack redis/redis-stack
```

Then you can load a bunch of recipes into the Redis Vector Store with the script `upload-cookbook.sh`.
